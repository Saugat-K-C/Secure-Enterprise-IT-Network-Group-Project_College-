# Project Scenario
Scenario  
XYZ Tech Solutions is a rapidly growing start-up based in Silicon Valley, specializing in software development 
and digital services. With a dynamic team of 200 full-time employees and up to 100 part-time contractors, XYZ 
Tech Solutions is expanding its operations and moving into a new office space. The company already has three 
offices in London, New York and Melbourne. With a diverse workforce and the need for seamless access to 
resources, XYZ Tech Solutions aims to upgrade its IT infrastructure by deploying Windows Server and 
implementing advanced features to enable consistent user experiences across different devices and locations. 
The company’s employees primarily work on their own computers and laptops, collaborating through online 
platforms. However, XYZ tech solutions recognises the need for centralised services for streamline operation 
and enhance data security.  
As a System administrator, the company wants you to implement the following: 
1) A Network diagram representing the give case. (You can use Visio, Draw.io, Packet tracer etc.) 
2) Windows web server (IIS), called XYZ Tech Solutions, to host a simple company website. The website 
is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP by one full-time employee, with assistance by one 
contractor. 
3) Backup server, called Back_SiliconValley, to store a backup of the web, and other servers on the 
network. 
4) DHCP server, called DHCP_SiliconValley, to provide dynamic IP addresses to workstations and laptops, 
and fixed IP addresses to other servers (based on MAC addresses). Only necessary full-time staff have 
access. 
5) Roaming profiles for the users. 
6) Deploy Active directory domain services for managing groups, users and resources within a network. 
7) All computers should acquire the IP addresses automatically from company’s DHCP server. 
8) Deploy Remote Desktop Services. 
9) Implement Network Policy and Access Services to provide network access control and authentication 
services. 
10) Implement Group Policy to enforce a password policy.
